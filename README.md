Training platform
Educational platform systems are becoming ubiquitous and are constantly gaining more and more customers: both teachers and students. From highly specialized university degree platforms like Coursera to practical, skill-oriented platforms like Skillshare, each targets a specific audience. The Covid-19 pandemic has caused an increase in the use of educational platform systems, which enable students to continue their formal education. A variety of tools, video-based teaching, a peer support system and user experience assessments make e-learning an attractive environment for enhancing one's knowledge and easily acquiring new skills. With platforms like EdApp, online course design has never been more accessible. With creative marketing tools and a professional support system, earning income from teaching becomes the dream job of future specialists. !
